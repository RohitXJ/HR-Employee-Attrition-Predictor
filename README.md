# 🧠 Employee Attrition Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the company. This system is trained on HR analytics data, carefully preprocessed, balanced using SMOTE, and deployed through a web interface for real-time predictions.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

Employee attrition is a key challenge faced by organizations. By analyzing employee characteristics, job satisfaction, and work environment data, this project aims to identify employees who are at risk of leaving.

The system uses **classification algorithms**, primarily **XGBoost** and **Random Forest**, trained and tuned to handle class imbalance. It is deployed as a simple web application where HR professionals can upload employee data and receive predictions instantly.

## 🌊 Dataset

* **Source**: [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)
* **Samples**: 1470 employees
* **Target Column**: `Attrition` (Yes/No)
* **Issue**: High class imbalance (No: 1233, Yes: 237)
* **Solution**: Applied **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)

---

## 🏗️ Project Features

* Clean, reproducible ML pipeline
* Encoded & scaled input features
* Balanced dataset using SMOTE
* Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
* Final model: **XGBoost**, tuned and exported using `pickle`
* Simple web app (Flask) hosted on Render

---

## 🧪 Model Evaluation (Final XGBoost)

* **Accuracy**: 92.43%
* **Precision (Leave class)**: 93%
* **Recall (Leave class)**: 91%
* **F1-score**: 0.92

Confusion Matrix:

```
[[345  24]  ← Stayed
 [ 32 339]] ← Left
```
